My personal notes of stuff worth remembering.

Made by:

- using [Emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca/) for rendering, based on the [emanote-template](https://github.com/srid/emanote-template)
- using GitHub Pages for hosting
- using [zk](https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk) and [neovim](https://neovim.io/) for editing

## Target audience
