# Stewart Brand

## Known for

The "information wants to be free" phrase that everyone quotes:

> "On the one hand **information wants to be expensive**, because it's so
> valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life.
>
> On the other hand, **information wants to be free**, because the cost of
> getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these
> two fighting against each other."[^curiosity-stream]
